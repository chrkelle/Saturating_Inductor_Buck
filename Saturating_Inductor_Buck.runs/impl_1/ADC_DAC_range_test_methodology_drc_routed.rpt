2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate pin clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ctrl_2_dac_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ctrl_2_dac_reg[10]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ctrl_2_dac_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ctrl_2_dac_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ctrl_2_dac_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ctrl_2_dac_reg[4]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ctrl_2_dac_reg[5]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ctrl_2_dac_reg[6]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#9 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ctrl_2_dac_reg[7]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#10 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin ctrl_2_dac_reg[8]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
